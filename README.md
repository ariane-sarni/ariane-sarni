## 1. Who I Am: The "Sim2Real" Generalist

I am a Robotics and Systems Engineer with a "full-stack" skillset that bridges the gap between low-level hardware and high-level cloud infrastructure.

My passion is in the **"Sim2Real" workflow**—taking complex autonomous systems from a simulation environment to a real-world, high-stakes hardware platform. I am the engineer who can write the C++/RTOS firmware for the robot, the Python/CUDA algorithm for its "brain," the Kubernetes/CARLA pipeline to test it, and the React/TS dashboard to control it.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-ownership roles where I can work on complex, mission-critical systems.

## 4. Career Highlights

### Integrated C++ on Real-Time Hardware (RTOS)
At **Skyline Nav AI**, I successfully integrated and debugged a C++ localization algorithm on an autonomous drone. This required me to work directly with a proprietary RTOS, manage system-level constraints, and debug hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) issues on unstable, pre-production hardware.

### 1000x GPU Acceleration (C++/CUDA)
I re-architected a critical C++ computer vision algorithm, porting its CPU-based implementation to a massively parallel GPGPU architecture using CUDA and PyTorch bindings. This resulted in a **1000x performance increase**, enabling the algorithm to run in real-time.

### Built a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Validation Pipeline
As an Autonomous Vehicle Researcher at **UCSC**, I architected a large-scale SIL testbed using Python, CARLA, Docker, and Kubernetes. This pipeline could benchmark autonomous driving models against thousands of safety-critical scenarios in parallel.

### Full-Stack Product Development (React/TS)
I built and delivered a full-stack customer demo from scratch, using React and TypeScript for the frontend and a Python/Flask backend. This project included backend optimizations that reduced API calls by **6x**.
